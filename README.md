# Apache Flink Snowflake Connector

The repository for the Apache Flink Snowflake connector.

## Apache Flink

Apache Flink is an open source stream processing framework with powerful stream- and batch-processing capabilities.

Learn more about Flink at [https://flink.apache.org/](https://flink.apache.org/)

## Building the Apache Flink Snowflake Connector from Source

Prerequisites:

* Unix-like environment (we use Linux, Mac OS X)
* Git
* Maven (we recommend version 3.8.6)
* Java 17

```
git clone https://github.com/deltastreaminc/flink-connector-snowflake.git
cd flink-connector-snowflake
mvn clean package -DskipTests
```

The resulting JARs can be found in the `target` directory of the respective module.

## Maven Dependency

The Snowflake connector can be imported into a Maven project using the following dependency:

```xml
<!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.deltastream/flink-connector-snowflake -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.deltastream</groupId>
    <artifactId>flink-connector-snowflake</artifactId>
    <version>${flink-connector-snowflake.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

Define a `flink-connector-snowflake.version` property in the `pom.xml` of the Maven project or replace `${flink-connector-snowflake.version}` with a version from [the Maven Central repository](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.deltastream/flink-connector-snowflake).

## Using the `SnowflakeSink` API

```java
class test {

    final SnowflakeSink<Map<String, Object>> sink =
        SnowflakeSink.<Map<String, Object>>builder()
            .url("account_url")
            .user("user_name")
            .role("role_name")
            .bufferTimeMillis(2000L)
            .database("DB_NAME")
            .schema("SCHEMA_NAME")
            .table("TABLE_NAME")
            .serializationSchema(SnowflakeRowSerializationSchemaImpl)
            .build("job_name_or_id");
}
```

where:

* `url` is the account URL given by Snowflake, e.g. `https://<account-id>.snowflakecomputing.com`.
* `user` is the username to use to connect to the Snowflake account.
* `role` is the role with access to the table within the Snowflake account.
* `bufferTimeMillis` is the time in milliseconds to buffer records before writing them to Snowflake. _NOTE: The buffer is also flushed when a checkpoint is triggered or the job is stopped._ See [Checkpointing with Flink](#checkpointing-with-flink).
* `database` is the database name within the Snowflake account. See note below about case sensitivity.
* `schema` is the schema name within the Snowflake account. See note below about case sensitivity.
* `table` is the table name within the Snowflake account. See note below about case sensitivity.
* `serializationSchema` is the serialization schema implementation of `SnowflakeRowSerializationSchema` to use to convert records to Snowflake rows.

In Snowflake, the full name of a table is case-insensitive, but UPPER_CASE biased. In other words, a sink configured with a fully qualified name of `DB.SCHEMA.table` is treated as `DB.SCHEMA.TABLE`. To be able to use case-sensitive name parts, add double quotes around them to be treated as the literal name, e.g. `DB.SCHEMA."table"`.

## Checkpointing with Flink

It's highly recommended that any checkpointing that happens using this connector to be configured to be at least 1 second to properly [optimize cost and performance](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-snowpipe-streaming-recommendation).

## Testing

### Required Credentials

The following credentials are used in the tests for integrating with the Snowflake service:

* `SNOWFLAKE_URL`: Account URL to use to connect to the account to write data to
* `SNOWFLAKE_USER`: Username to write data as
* `SNOWFLAKE_ROLE`: Database role to write data as
* `SNOWFLAKE_PRIVATE_KEY`: User's private key to use for connecting to the service
* `SNOWFLAKE_KEY_PASSPHRASE`: User's private key password to use for connecting to the service, as supported by OpenSSL guidelines

### Integration Test

Using the Required Credentials, test Snowflake integration with a simple write to the configured Snowflake account:

```shell
mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test
```

Unit tests are run in the `test` phase:

```shell
mvn clean test
```

To debug issues with the tests, set the `rootLogger.level` in the `flink-connector-snowflake/src/test/resources/log4j2-test.properties` to `INFO` or `DEBUG`.

## IntelliJ IDEA

The IntelliJ IDE supports Maven out of the box:

* IntelliJ download: [https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)

Setup CheckStyle for static coding guidelines within IntelliJ IDEA:

1. Go to `Settings` → `Tools` → `Checkstyle`.
2. Set `Scan Scope` to `Only Java sources (including tests)`.
3. For `Checkstyle Version` select `8.14`.
4. Under `Configuration File` click the `+` icon to add a new configuration.
5. Set `Description` to `Flink`.
6. Select `Use a local Checkstyle file` and point it to tools/maven/checkstyle.xml located within your cloned repository.
7. Select `Store relative to project location` and click `Next`.
8. Configure the property checkstyle.suppressions.file with the value suppressions.xml and click `Next`.
9. Click `Finish`.
10. Select `Flink` as the only active configuration file and click `Apply`.

You can now import the Checkstyle configuration for the Java code formatter.

1. Go to `Settings` → `Editor` → `Code Style` → `Java`.
2. Click the gear icon next to `Scheme` and select `Import Scheme` → `Checkstyle Configuration`.
3. Navigate to and select tools/maven/checkstyle.xml located within your cloned repository.

To verify the setup, click `View` → `Tool Windows` → `Checkstyle` and find the `Check Module` button in the opened tool window. It should report no violations.
