# Apache Flink Snowflake Connector

The repository for the Apache Flink Snowflake connector.

## Apache Flink

Apache Flink is an open source stream processing framework with powerful stream- and batch-processing capabilities.

Learn more about Flink at [https://flink.apache.org/](https://flink.apache.org/)

## Building the Apache Flink Snowflake Connector from Source

Prerequisites:

* Unix-like environment (we use Linux, Mac OS X)
* Git
* Maven (we recommend version 3.8.6)
* Java 11

```
git clone https://github.com/deltastreaminc/flink-connector-snowflake.git
cd flink-connector-snowflake
mvn clean package -DskipTests
```

The resulting JARs can be found in the `target` directory of the respective module.

## Using the `SnowflakeSink` API

```java
class test {

    final SnowflakeSink<Map<String, Object>> sink =
        SnowflakeSink.<Map<String, Object>>builder()
            .url("account_url")
            .user("user_name")
            .role("role_name")
            .bufferTimeMillis(2000L)
            .database("db_name")
            .schema("schema_name")
            .table("table_name")
            .serializationSchema(SnowflakeRowSerializationSchemaImpl)
            .build("job_name_or_id");
}
```

## Required Credentials

The following credentials are used in the tests for integrating with the Snowflake service:

* `SNOWFLAKE_URL`: Account URL to use to connect to the account to write data to
* `SNOWFLAKE_USER`: Username to write data as
* `SNOWFLAKE_ROLE`: Database role to write data as
* `SNOWFLAKE_PRIVATE_KEY`: User's private key to use for connecting to the service
* `SNOWFLAKE_KEY_PASSPHRASE`: User's private key password to use for connecting to the service

## Developing Flink

The Flink committers use IntelliJ IDEA to develop the Flink codebase.
We recommend IntelliJ IDEA for developing projects that involve Scala code.

Minimal requirements for an IDE are:
* Support for Java and Scala (also mixed projects)
* Support for Maven with Java and Scala

### IntelliJ IDEA

The IntelliJ IDE supports Maven out of the box and offers a plugin for Scala development:

* IntelliJ download: [https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
* IntelliJ Scala Plugin: [https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/?id=1347](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/?id=1347)
